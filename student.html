    <h1>Student Page</h1>
    <p>If you are NOT a current student, please access the Staff or Guest portals, or return to the home page. </p>
    <p>Here, students can easily access relevant course material, academic records, timetables and support documents. </p>

    <h2>Academic Resources</h2>
    <p>Access to the student portal: A centralized hub for accessing academic records, course materials, and communication with instructors. 

    Study resources: Links to library databases, academic writing guides, and online tutoring services. 

    Academic support: Information about study skills workshops, peer mentoring programs, and academic counseling services. 

    For each unit you are studying, you will have a reading list and may have a prescribed textbook. The reading list includes compulsory and recommended reading resources, including books, book chapters, journal articles, websites and media. 

    You will find your reading list and textbook information in your unit site on DeakinSync during OWeek. 

    You can also access this information on the Deakin Library website: 

    you can enter unit code in the search bar to access your readings for a unit. 

    you can use the Get Textbooks page to find out which textbooks are prescribed and/or recommended for a unit. 

    If you can't borrow your textbook from the library, you can buy your textbooks online. Deakin does not sell textbooks directly: you can purchase them online in both print and e-book format from either the publisher or a book e-retailer. Remember to check you have the correct edition listed for your unit. </p>

    <h2>Student Support Services</h2>
    <p>Counseling and wellbeing: Access to mental health support services, counseling appointments, and resources for managing stress and wellbeing. 

    Disability support: Information about accommodations for students with disabilities and how to access support services. 

    Career services: Guidance on career exploration, job search strategies, resume writing, and interview preparation. </p>

    <h2>Academic Records</h2>
    <p>A Statement of Results is an unofficial record of your results. It's free and you can access it through StudentConnect. 

    A Statement of Results is not available for earlier institutions of Deakin, such as the Gordon Institute of Technology, State College of Victoria (Geelong/Warrnambool), IAE and Victoria College (Burwood/Toorak/Clayton). 

    Academic transcript 

    This is your official record of study at Deakin. It lists your course, units, majors and specialisations, grades, dates of study and any honours. Prospective employers may use it to verify your qualifications. A transcript also lists units you may have failed, even if you attempt and pass them a second time. 

    You can order a print or digital copy of your academic transcript online or by contacting Student Central. Digital versions are provided through the secure online platform, My eQuals. </p>
